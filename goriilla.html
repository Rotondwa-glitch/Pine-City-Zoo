                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and one of our closest relatives, sharing about 98% of our DNA. They belong to the genus *Gorilla*, which is split into two species: the Eastern gorilla and the Western gorilla.</p>

    <p>Gorillas are intelligent, social animals that live in tight-knit family groups led by a dominant male known as a silverback (named after the silvery patch of hair on his back). These peaceful giants communicate using grunts, body posture, and even facial expressions.</p>

    <p>Despite their intimidating size and strength, gorillas are mostly vegetarian, feasting on leaves, fruit, shoots, and stems. They spend much of their day foraging and resting in the dense forests of Central Africa.</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You can find the gorillas in enclosure G13, near the rainforest section next to the waterfall exhibit.</p>
