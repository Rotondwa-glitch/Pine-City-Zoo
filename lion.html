                            <h3>LION</h3>
    <p>Lions are large carnivorous mammals that belong to the family Felidae. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions (Panthera leo) are social animals that live in groups called prides. These majestic cats are primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population also living in India (the Asiatic lion).</p>
    
    <p>Male lions are recognized by their impressive manes, which vary in color and size and serve as a sign of health and dominance. Lions can grow up to 3.3 meters (11 feet) in length including the tail, and weigh between 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb). Females are smaller and usually do most of the hunting for the pride.</p>

    <p>Lions are apex predators and mainly hunt large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffaloes. They are also known for their powerful roars, which can be heard up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) away. Lions are mostly active at night and spend a lot of their day resting and conserving energy.</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions at enclosure L10, near the big rock formation beside the safari caf√©.</p>
