                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, famous for their fluffy ears, button noses, and chilled-out lifestyle. Despite being called "koala bears," they aren’t bears at all — they’re closer to kangaroos and wombats.</p>

    <p>These cuddly-looking creatures spend most of their time sleeping — up to 18–22 hours a day! When they're awake, they're usually busy munching on eucalyptus leaves, which are both their food and their water source.</p>

    <p>Koalas live high up in the trees, gripping branches with their strong claws and opposable thumbs. They’re mostly solitary and communicate with deep grunts or squeaky baby-like calls during mating season.</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Look for the koalas in enclosure K04, nestled in the eucalyptus grove near the Australian Outback zone.</p>
