                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>The warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grasslands, savannas, and woodlands throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Despite their rugged looks and big tusks, warthogs are mostly herbivores and enjoy munching on grasses, roots, and berries.</p>

    <p>They’re known for their distinctive facial warts (which are actually thick protective pads) and impressive curved tusks that help them dig and defend themselves. When threatened, warthogs can sprint up to 50 km/h — tails straight up like antennae!</p>

    <p>Warthogs live in burrows and will often back into them to keep their tusks facing out toward any predators. They're also pretty chill with sharing their burrows with others, especially during cold nights.</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Catch the warthogs living their best muddy life in area W5, just past the savanna section and near the meerkat mound.</p>
