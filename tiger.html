                            <h3>TIGER</h3>
    <p>The tiger is the largest member of the cat family and one of the most powerful predators on land. Known for its striking orange coat with black stripes, it rules the forests and grasslands of Asia.</p>

    <p>There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, and Sumatran tiger. Each has adapted to different environments, from snowy Russian forests to the hot mangrove swamps of India.</p>

    <p>Tigers are solitary hunters, using their camouflage and strength to stalk prey before launching a lightning-fast ambush. Despite their fearsome rep, they’re also graceful swimmers and have been known to cross rivers and lakes with ease.</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Visit the tiger habitat at zone T10 — a lush, jungle-themed enclosure located right past the Big Cat Bridge.</p>
