                        <h3>GEMSOK</h3>
                        <img src="images/gemsok.jpg"/>
                        <p>The Gemsbok, also known as the gemsbuck or Oryx gazella, is a large antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. Recognized by its striking black-and-white facial markings and long, straight horns, the gemsbok is well adapted to desert environments. Its light-colored coat reflects sunlight, and it can survive for long periods without direct water, obtaining moisture from the plants it eats.</p>
                        <p>Gemsbok are social animals, typically found in herds of 10 to 40 individuals. They are herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, and tubers. Both males and females have impressive horns, which can reach up to 85 cm (33 in) in length and are used for defense against predators.</p>
                        <p>These antelope are known for their strength and agility, able to run at high speeds to escape danger. Their natural habitat includes open plains, savannahs, and deserts, where they blend in with the landscape and thrive in harsh conditions.</p>
                        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen G12, near the desert habitat exhibit.</p>
                        <p>The gemsbok is an important species in its ecosystem, playing a role in maintaining the balance of plant life through its grazing habits. Their ability to survive in harsh, dry environments makes them a symbol of resilience in the animal kingdom. In addition to their ecological significance, gemsbok are also admired for their striking appearance and are featured in the national symbols of countries like Namibia. Conservation efforts are in place to ensure their populations remain stable, as habitat loss and hunting can pose threats in some regions.</p>
