                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, belonging to the species *Giraffa camelopardalis*. These graceful herbivores are known for their extremely long necks and legs, as well as their distinctive coat patterns made up of irregular patches.</p>

    <p>Adult giraffes can reach heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) and weigh as much as 1,200 kilograms (2,600 pounds). Despite their height, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans—seven!—but each one is super-sized.</p>

    <p>They use their long necks to reach the leaves of tall trees, especially acacia trees, which are a favorite food source. Giraffes have a long, prehensile tongue (up to 45 cm!) that helps them grasp and strip leaves with ease.</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at enclosure G7, near the tall trees at the northern edge of the zoo trail.</p>
