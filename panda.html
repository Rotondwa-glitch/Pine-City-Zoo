                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are native to the mountainous regions of central China. They're instantly recognizable with their iconic black-and-white fur and their obsession with bamboo.</p>

    <p>Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas are almost entirely herbivorous — bamboo makes up about 99% of their diet! They use their strong jaws and pseudo-thumbs (an extended wrist bone) to grasp and munch bamboo stalks with ease.</p>

    <p>Pandas are generally solitary animals and spend most of their day eating and sleeping. They can eat up to 14 hours a day and snooze the rest away. Talk about living the dream!</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You can find the pandas at enclosure P05, right next to the Bamboo Forest Café — go say hey and watch them snack!</p>
