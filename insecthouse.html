                            <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
    <p>The Insect House is a fascinating exhibit dedicated to some of nature’s smallest yet most extraordinary creatures. From leafcutter ants and beetles to butterflies and tarantulas, this place is crawling (literally) with life!</p>

    <p>Insects make up the largest group of animals on Earth, with millions of species doing everything from pollinating flowers to breaking down dead matter. Despite their tiny size, insects play a HUGE role in ecosystems around the world.</p>

    <p>Visitors can explore live colonies, see insects at work, and even walk through a butterfly dome where colorful wings flap all around you. It's weird, wild, and way more fun than you’d expect!</p>

    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
    <p>The Insect House is located in zone B8, tucked between the reptile garden and the botanical walk.</p>
